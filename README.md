The best way to say "I use Linux btw 🤓" is if your desktop environment looks sleek and suave.

Powered by Hyprland, this project does not define itself as "just a rice." **NeKoRoSHELL** aims to provide an out-of-the-box, clean and reliable, generic, and modular framework that lets you easily customize your desktop experience with simple UI design philosophy in mind.

## [Features](CHANGELOG.md)

NeKoRoSHELL focuses on simplicity and modularity.
<br>

The following are what NeKoRoSHELL currently offers:
- **Portable and Distro-agnostic**
  - Use NeKoRoSHELL in any **supported** distro!
  - Init-agnostic.
  - XDG-compliant.
  - Features an advanced installer script.
    - Use `git clone https://github.com/NeKoRoSYS/NeKoRoSHELL`
    - Then `cd NeKoRoSHELL`
    - and finally, `bash install.sh` to install the dotfiles.
    - `install.sh` assumes you already have `git` and a distro-specific `g++` compiler.
    - `install.sh` requires you to have `cargo`, `paru`/`yay`, `go`, and `flatpak`.
    - You can freely customize `flatpak.txt` and `pkglist-DISTRO.txt` before running `install.sh`.
    - **The installer is safe.** It backs up your pre-existing .config folders. (If you have any)
    - The installer automatically handles assigning your monitors at `~/.config/hypr/configs/monitors.conf/` and replaces every occurence of `/home/nekorosys/` with your username for your own convenience.
    - SOME distros don't have hyprland or other dependencies on their package manager's repository and you may have to manually build them from source via script or something else.

- **NeKoRoSHELL as a Service**
  - Update your copy of NeKoRoSHELL simply by running the `nekoroshell update` command on your terminal.
  - Uses Vim or your preferred text editor to assist in reviewing file updates and gives the ability to overwrite, keep, and merge.
   
- **Window Controls**
  - Maximize
  - Fullscreen
  - Toggle Opacity
  - Toggle Floating Window
  - Pseudo-floating/organized windows
  - Change tile placement

- **Copying and Pasting**
  - Screenshot support via `hyprshot` .
  - Clipboard history via `cliphist`.
 
- **Notificications Handling**
  - Uses `SwayNC` for a dedicated notification center with customizable buttons and options.
 
- **Smart Navbar**
  - Uses portable WM-agnostic C++ wrappers for `waybar` to toggle visibility modes: Static, Dynamic, and Hover.

  <img src="https://github.com/NeKoRoSYS/NeKoRoSHELL/blob/main/showcase/navbar-modes.gif" alt="Navbar Demo" />
</p>

- **Advanced Customization - Make NeKoRoSHELL YOURS!**
  - NeKoRoSHELL is not just an identity, it is a framework. This repo gives you at most 2 pre-installed out-of-the-box layouts/styling for waybar, hyprlock, and SwayNC. The best part? You can make your own!
  - Switch to Dark and Light contrast modes
  - [Dedicated Theming System](THEMING.md):
    - Select individual skins for waybar, rofi, hyprlock, SwayNC, wlogout, and even hyprland windows.
    - **Wallpaper Handling**
      - Supports both online and offline image (via `awww`) and video (via `mpvpaper`) formats.
        - `mpvpaper` automatically stops if an app is on fullscreen mode to save CPU/RAM and GPU space.
        - Paste image or video links with valid file extensions in the rofi prompt and the download will automatically be processed, saved, and set as your new wallpaper.
      - Uses `wallust` to dynamically update border and UI colors based on the percieved colors of from the wallpaper.
    - Make and select your own Themes that automatically apply skins and wallpapers.

### Roadmap

NeKoRoSHELL is currently being developed by one person (*cough* [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/NeKoRoSYS/NeKoRoSHELL/tree/main?tab=contributing-ov-file#) *cough*) and is constantly under rigorous quality assurance for improvement. We always aim to keep a "no-break" promise for every update so that you can safely update to later versions without expecting any breakages.

### Beyond "NeKoRoSHELL"

In the near future, I plan to expand upon what makes NeKoRoSHELL, well, "NeKoRoSHELL." The following plans MAY or MAY NOT happen, so do take it with a grain of salt:
- **NeKoRoSHELL Headless**: A plug-and-play fork of NeKoRoSHELL that lets you integrate the config files and scripts to any wayland-based window manager/compositor.
- **NeKoRoSHELL DLux (2.0)**: A reimagining of NeKoRoSHELL that uses Quickshell instead of waybar, SwayNC, rofi, and other packages in an effort to unify everything into a seamless experience. The release of DLux will effectively rebrand this project as "NeKoRoSHELL Legacy."
<br>

## Dependencies

> [!CAUTION]
> **HARDWARE SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**<br>
>
> Some environment variables and params at `~/.config/hypr/configs/environment.conf/` and `~/.config/hypr/scripts/set-wallpaper.sh/` (also check the `check-video.sh` script, `mpvpaper` uses a "hwdec=nvdec" param) **require an NVIDIA graphics card**. Although it may be generally safe to leave it as is upon installing to a machine without such GPU, I recommend commenting it out or replacing it with a variable that goes according to your GPU.

> [!WARNING]
> **SOFTWARE SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**<br>
>
> This project of mine was originally built only for Arch Linux but is now capable of claiming itself to be Distro-agnostic. However, **installation of this repo in other Linux Distros aside from Arch is more or less UNTESTED.** Please verify using `nano` or your preferred text editor if your distro supports the packages listed at `pkglist-DISTRO.txt` or if the packages are named correctly.
>
> The installation system that I implemented can be improved. If you're willing to help, please make a pull request. Your contributions are welcome and will be appreciated! :D

- `nekoroshell update` may use Vim to compare, overwrite, or merge files when updating.
- Auto-pause animated wallpapers via [mpvpaper-stop](https://github.com/pvtoari/mpvpaper-stop) (dependencies: cmake, cjson)
  - Used at `set-wallpaper.sh` and `check-video.sh` in `~/.config/hypr/scripts/wallpapers/` to save CPU/RAM usage.
- Install [Hypremoji](https://github.com/Musagy/hypremoji)
- Fix waybar tray disappearing after a certain amount of time by installing `sni-qt`.
  Make sure you're not killing waybar using -SIGUSER2 when refreshing the config.
<br>

## Acknowledgements
- NeKoRoSHELL is fundamentally different and built with strict design/philosophy in mind; however, it's worth to mention that it is partially inspired by [JaKooLit's Hyprland Dots](github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/). Frankly, I only found out about the repository while I am deep into polising v1.6 and I realized how similar the two projects are. Given this, it is inevitable that I may use their project as reference for future updates while still keeping the features grounded enough to fit into NeKoRoSHELL.

- Amelie ([@S-e-r-a-p-h-i-n-e](https://github.com/S-e-r-a-p-h-i-n-e)) for helping me transition the project from using pywal16 to wallust and letting me borrow a few scripts. Go check out [SeraDOTS](https://github.com/S-e-r-a-p-h-i-n-e/SeraDOTS)!

- April for helping me figure out the cause of the now-fixed "keybinds not working" issue.

- [@MiroBG](https://github.com/MiroBG) for helping me track issues within the repo.

- Credits to [justinmdickey](https://github.com/justinmdickey/publicdots/blob/main/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf), and [mkhmtolzhas](https://github.com/mkhmtolzhas/mkhmtdots) for their amazing designs.
  - The `legacy` theme was based on mkhmtolzha's waybar stylesheet and layout, just heavily modified and made to be thematically-consistent across packages like SwayNC.

## Fonts and cursor

The default appearance uses JetBrains Mono Nerd Font and the Bibata-Modern-Ice cursor. Both font packages and the Bibata cursor package are included in the Arch dependency manifest.
